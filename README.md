# Vehicle Entry Exit Backend

## Objective

The objective of this project was to develop a robust and secure backend system for managing vehicle entry and exit within a university or similar environment. This system provides a comprehensive solution for user management, vehicle registration, access control, and logging, leveraging Spring Boot, JWT authentication, and MongoDB (with a planned migration to MariaDB). The implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that different user roles (User, Security Guard, Manager) have appropriate access and permissions.

### Skills Learned

-   Development of a RESTful API using Spring Boot.
-   Implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication.
-   Database management with MongoDB (and planning for MariaDB migration).
-   Design and implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
-   Generation and handling of QR codes.
-   Log management and data retrieval.
-   Understanding of application security principles.
-   Experience with version control using Git.

### Tools Used

-   Spring Boot: For backend development and REST API creation.
-   JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure authentication and authorization.
-   MongoDB: For database management (initially), planned migration to MariaDB.
-   Maven/Gradle: For dependency management and build automation.
-   Postman/Insomnia/ThunderClient: For API testing.
-   Git: For version control.
-   (Future) MariaDB: For relational database management.
